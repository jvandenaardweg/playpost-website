              We have noticed the web is full of interesting long read articles
              that go in depth on a certain subject. If your interest in these
              articles is high, then you probably wished you had more time to
              read during the day. Reality is; we also do other things than
              sitting and reading. We commute. We drive. We walk. We cycle. We
              do our everyday chores.
