              <h2>About this crawler</h2>
              <p>
                Playpost is a service that allows users to save article's to
                their personal playlist and then create audio of that article.
                So they can listen to articles, instead of reading them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The crawler is part of how Playpost works. It involves crawling
                the user's saved articles to retrieve information such as the
                title, description, content, images and other article related
                data so the system can show the user information about the
                article.
              </p>

              <p>
                Playpost does not save any aticle data unless a particular user
                requests it. That said, the article data is only available for
                the user that saved it through Playpostâ€™s service.
              </p>
