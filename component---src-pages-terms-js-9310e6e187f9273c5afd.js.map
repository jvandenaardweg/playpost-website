Except as\n                provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the\n                Licensed Application available over a network where it could be\n                used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer,\n                redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you\n                sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the\n                Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You\n                may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage\n                Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the\n                source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the\n                Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except\n                as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is\n                prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be\n                permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any\n                open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect\n                and use technical data and related information—including but not\n                limited to technical information about your device, system and\n                application software, and peripherals—that is gathered\n                periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates,\n                product support, and other services to you (if any) related to\n                the Licensed Application.

Your rights under this Standard EULA will\n                terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its\n                terms.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                d.

You agree\n                to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not\n                responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy\n                of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable\n                for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by\n                any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not\n                limited to financial, medical and location information, is for\n                general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by\n                Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services\n                in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this\n                Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights\n                of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the\n                External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame\n                any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for\n                any such use. External Services may not be available in all\n                languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or\n                available for use in any particular location. To the extent you\n                choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible\n                for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the\n                right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access\n                restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time\n                without notice or liability to you.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                e.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n                LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR\n                CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n                In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all\n                damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in\n                cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty\n                dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if\n                the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                g.
