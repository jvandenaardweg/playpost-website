          <p>Last update: 27-06-2019 09:19</p>

          <h2 class="display-3">Introduction</h2>

          <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
            therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
            app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
            source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
            derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
            intellectual
            property rights related to it, still belong to Playpost.</p>

          <h2 class="display-3">Changes to the app</h2>
          <p>Playpost is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
            that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
            and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
            to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

          <h2 class="display-3">Personal data</h2>
          <p>The Playpost app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
            our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
            recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
            restrictions
            and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
            to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
            the Playpost app won’t work properly or at all. </p>

          <h2 class="display-3">Responsibility</h2>
          <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Playpost will not take responsibility
            for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
            can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Playpost cannot take responsibility
            for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
            of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
            agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
            your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
            app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
            or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
            payer for using the app.</p>
          <p>Along the same lines, Playpost cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
            the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Playpost cannot accept responsibility.</p>
          <p>With respect to Playpost’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
            the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
            correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
            it available to you. Playpost accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
          <p>Playpost cannot be held responsible for articles not being processed correctly when those articles are behind a pay-wall or require a login. As the Service only has access to the publicly available articles.
             </p>
          <p>
            The app enforces a fair use policy, meaning there is a restriction applied to heavy users. Therefore usage is restricted with a max of 30 minutes per article. And monthly limited to 300 minutes per user. The user will be notified when that limit is reached.
          </p>
          <h2 class="display-3">App Updates</h2>
          <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
            requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
            of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
            app. Playpost does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
            to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
            you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
            stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
            to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
            you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
            device.
          </p>

Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.<p>a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).<p>b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application.

This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. <p>d. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.<p>g.
