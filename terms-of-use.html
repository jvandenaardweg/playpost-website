          <h1 class="display-1">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <p>Last update: 19-04-2019 14:19</p>
          <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
            therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
            app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
            source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
            derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
            intellectual
            property rights related to it, still belong to Aardweg Media.</p>
          <p>Aardweg Media is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
            that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
            and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
            to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
          <p>The Playpost app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
            our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
            recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
            restrictions
            and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
            to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
            the Playpost app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
          <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Aardweg Media will not take responsibility
            for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
            can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Aardweg Media cannot take responsibility
            for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
            of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
            agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
            your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
            app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
            or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
            payer for using the app.</p>
          <p>Along the same lines, Aardweg Media cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
            the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Aardweg Media cannot accept responsibility.</p>
          <p>With respect to Aardweg Media’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
            the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
            correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
            it available to you. Aardweg Media accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
          <p>Aardweg Media cannot be held responsible for articles not being processed correctly when those articles are behind a pay-wall or require a login. As the Service only has access to the publicly available articles.
             </p>
          <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
            requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
            of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
            app. Aardweg Media does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
            to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
            you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
            stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
            to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
            you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
            device.
          </p>
